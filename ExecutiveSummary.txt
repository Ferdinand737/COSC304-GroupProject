Our service will provide customers with fast and easy access to the groceries that they need most.  After the monsoon that hit BC in November, many transport routes are still struggling to recover because of the damage to highways. That is where our service comes in, using cutting edge monkey training, we are able to go right around all the mess on the highways and deliver straight to your front step.

Our monkeys have been specially trained to follow GPS directions, so they can bring your order straight from our distributing centres to your doorstep. We offer a variety of products for all of your grocery needs, at nearly the same prices you will find at a local grocery store! Why wait for trucks to supply your nearest market, when you can have a monkey drop off all the groceries you could ever need right at your house.

Unlike other grocery delivery services, our monkeys are more than happy to deliver all your food straight to you. All our willing employees are supplied for a lifetime with all the bananas they possibly eat, keeping them extremely motivated to bring you your food. We have a supply of beverages, condiments, dairy, produce, meats, seafood, confections, and grains to suit your liking. Come, and let us show you the future of delivery.
