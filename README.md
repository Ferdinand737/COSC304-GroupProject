SYSTEM FEATURE SUMMARY PAGE
Explanatory text:
Welcome to the MAF feature sheet! If you have not signed our NDA, please cease to read. Once you’ve signed off on our favorite document, please feel free to observe the feature of your new purchase!

Feature list:
•	Search Bar:
 	We’ve teamed up with the brightest mind on the art of “question asking” and implemented a fantastic solution to a common consumer problem; a search bar. By simply typing the name of the item you want our engineers have created a way to show you exactly that item!

•	Browse products by category:
 	Have you forgotten the name of the thingamajig that you wanted? But you remember that it was something meaty? You’ll now be able to find the exact item you need based on only that information! Our engineers have line-by-line entered the information needed to cater a perfect result to even your most semi-perfect query.

•	List products with image:
 	Is reading a product description not enough? Do your eyes crave more stimulation? Of course they do! Eyes have been growing more hungry by the day so we’ve sourced the best we could find to create a proprietary image database just for our customers.  Each product has a tantalizing visual for your viewing pleasure!

•	Page header with menu:
Wouldn’t it be nice to turn back time and avoid the dreadful consequences of our mistakes? My parents think so! In their honor our engineers have been hard at work to enable a way to navigate forward and backwards in our website with just a few simple clicks of our header menu!

•	Improved UI (user-friendly, images, etc.):
	Our users are at least the third most important thing to us! So, our engineers have sculpted the most divine UI they’ve ever made!

•	Product recommendation based on user:
 	We understand that users crave comfort, familiarity and a feeling of safety with their purchases, so we’ve implemented a system to recommend products as a reminder that they are as predictable as they feared.

•	Product detail page and item description:
 	Users often forget what the function of a given product is due to a lack of object permanence! While we can’t develop their post-natal skills, we can describe any object on our store!

•	User account header:
    A safe reminder to our users who they are, just incase we reach them in a state of existential doubt.

•	Create user account page:
 	The average shopping experience lacks that charade of individualism that glues our fragile psyche together, so our developers have implemented a user account system to make our customers experience more “them”, to the extent that we find profitable!

•	Edit user account info (address, password):
 	Our large inventory of user information loses its value to third parties if they’re out of date. Thankfully users can tell is if they’ve moved!

•	Ability to enter a review on a product:
 	We won’t host a product that will not sell unless we’ve been paid handsomely to keep it on our shelves. To know if need to pursue manipulation tactics we’ve included an advanced review system to monitor public perception of our products! 

•	Restrict to one review per user on item purchased
 	Should any of the manufacturers of our products fall into another ‘scandal’ their products are protected from ‘review bombing’ as a user can only submit one review per account!

•	Display item inventory by store/warehouse
 	Nosy customers may want to know where their items ship from so we’ve included the name of the warehouse that the given product ships from!

•	Admin Account
 	Not all accounts are created equal! Assert your superiority as a being superior to your clientele by creating an Admin Account! With this account you’ll have special access to a large array of functions!

•	Admin Function: List all customers.
 	Want to immediately see whose shopping at your store? Need to know what your ex is buying? We’ve included a ‘list all customers” functions so you know everything about your customers!  

•	Admin Function: Update/Delete Product
 	Product reviews got you down? Hide the negativity by deleting or updating the product information!

•	Admin Function: Database Restore
Made an oopsie? Need to hide it before your quarterly report? Take the nuclear option! Give your data base a hard reset with one easy to push button!
